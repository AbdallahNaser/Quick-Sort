# Quick Sort Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the **Quick Sort** algorithm, a highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm.

## Overview
Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm with the following key characteristics:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Best Case: O(n log n)
  - Average Case: O(n log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) (recursive calls)
- **Algorithm Type:** Comparison-based, in-place

## Features
- Implemented in **C++**.
- Supports sorting arrays/lists of integers, floats, or other comparable data types.
- Includes efficient partitioning methods for optimal performance.

## File Structure
- `QuickSort.cpp`: Contains the implementation of Quick Sort.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quick-sort.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd quick-sort
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o quick_sort QuickSort.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./quick_sort
   ```

## Algorithm Steps
1. Pick a pivot element from the array.
2. Partition the array into two subarrays:
   - Elements less than the pivot.
   - Elements greater than or equal to the pivot.
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays.
4. Combine the sorted subarrays to get the final sorted array.

## Example Input and Output
### Input
```plaintext
Array: [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]
```
### Output
```plaintext
Sorted Array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
```
